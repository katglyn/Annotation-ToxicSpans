Hello!

This is a small depository of which revolves around two pillars:

Firstly, there is a file which includes the annotation project that I conducted with the task itself, the instructions and the results which are color coded.

The annotation project is broken down into three stages.

Secondly for the paper I am publishing, I employed three different word lists.

The first database was kindly provided by the supervisors of these thesis, who are also the organisers of a toxicity detection contest (Pavlopoulos & Androutsopoulos). 
The data have not officially been published yet. Out of this database a word list or lexicon from the annotated toxic spans is made.

The second database or more appropriately word list, was put together from online sources, primarily from GitHub (Ali, 2017) 
and other sites which offer free access to so called “bad” word lists (Parker, 2019). Since the database to be investigated is in English, 
the word lists are also the english language. Although the existence of public resources is stated to be limited in other papers, 
the used word lists were too provided in up to twelve different languages. The preprocessing began for the extraction of information.

The third piece of data is too, a word list. This word list was taken in whole from Michael Wiegand, who uploaded the list to be accessed freely by the public. 
The repository contains resources created from his paper (Wiegand et al., 2019). 


Useful definitions:

The thesis revolves around the topic of toxicity. An additional definition that is going to be important is the one regarding “toxic spans”. 
A toxic span can be titled as a word or complex of words more commonly known as a phrase that includes or is in its entirety offensive.


As a “a priori” toxic span can be stated as any word or phrase that is generally admitted to be offensive by itself without the need of definition checking.  

e.x: bitch, crap, asshole


As “a posteriori” can be titled  as the complementary of apriori toxic span. It is a word or a phrase that doesn't include any offensive words. 
The toxicity is not revealed when taken out of context. When put back however into their original form however the toxicity and offensiveness manifests. 

e.x: trip over a knife, you look incredible when i have my eyes closed


This is a binary categorisation therefore, if one toxic span is considered to be a priori, it can not be a posteriori and vice versa.
